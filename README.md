# NZA-Census-Places-Counties

## Summary
This repository was created to help state teams working with the [National Zoning Atlas](https://www.zoningatlas.org/) collect county and place-level data from the U.S. Census Bureau. The outputs include an Excel workbook listing census places by type (e.g., city, town, borough, etc.) by largest county overlap, a water-clipped shapefile of census places, and a coastline-clipped shapefile of counties. These outputs are generated for whichever state(s) the user specifies.

## Contents
This repository includes two folders: `scripts` and `tables`.
